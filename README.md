# Lead_Scoring_Case_Study
Problem Statement

Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, an education firm. Many experts who are interested in the courses visit their website and look through the offerings on any given day. On their website, there is a form-filling process that leads to the company receiving the individual as a lead. After obtaining these leads, sales team members begin calling, emailing, and so on.Some of the leads convert during this process, but the majority do not. At X education, the lead conversion rate is typically 30%.
This implies that just around 30 of the leads, say, that they generate each day will actually be converted. The organization wants to find the most potential leads, or "Hot Leads," in order to streamline this procedure.The lead conversion rate should increase if they are able to locate this group of leads because the sales staff will now be spending more time corresponding with the prospects rather than calling everyone.

Business Goal

Lead X requests that we create a model that assigns a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each lead. in order to detect the Hot leads and boost their conversion rate simultaneously. The CEO hopes to reach an 80% lead conversion rate. Future restrictions, such as the need for peak time actions, how to use all available manpower, and what to do after a target is reached, are other things they want the model to be able to manage.
